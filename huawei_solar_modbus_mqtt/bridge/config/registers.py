"""Essential Modbus registers for Huawei SUN2000 inverters.

This module defines which registers to read from the inverter. Register names
correspond to the huawei_solar library, based on the official Huawei Modbus
specification.

Strategy:
    Read only essential registers (58) instead of all available (100+) to
    reduce cycle time (2-3s vs 10+s), network load, and log size.

Hardware compatibility:
    Not all registers are available on all systems:
    - PV String 3/4: Only on larger inverters
    - Battery registers: Only with LUNA2000
    - Smart Meter: Only with SDongleA/DDSU666
    - Phase B/C: Only on 3-phase systems

    Missing registers return 65535 (Modbus "not available") and are
    automatically filtered.
