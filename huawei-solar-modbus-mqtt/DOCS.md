# Huawei Solar Modbus to MQTT

> **⚠️ CRITICAL: Only ONE Modbus Connection Allowed!**
>
> Huawei inverters have a **fundamental limitation**: They allow **only ONE active Modbus TCP connection** at the same time. This is a **hardware limitation** and the most common error in smart home integration.
>
> ### Typical Error Scenarios:
>
> ❌ **Official Huawei Solar Integration AND this add-on** → Both fighting for connection  
> ❌ **Multiple Home Assistant Instances** → Only one can connect  
> ❌ **FusionSolar App + Modbus active** → Cloud shows "Abnormal"  
> ❌ **Monitoring Software + Home Assistant** → Intermittent timeouts
>
> ### ✅ Before installation, CHECK:
>
> 1. **Home Assistant Integrations:**
>    - Settings → Devices & Services
>    - Search for "Huawei" or "Solar"
>    - Remove ALL other Huawei integrations (wlcrs/huawei_solar, HACS, etc.)
> 2. **Disable other software:**
>    - Monitoring tools (e.g., Solar-Analytics)
>    - Mobile apps with Modbus access
>    - Other Home Assistant instances
> 3. **FusionSolar Cloud:**
>    - Cloud works PARALLEL to Modbus
>    - But: Cloud shows "Abnormal Communication" → **ignore it!**
>    - Cloud data continues to be transmitted
> 4. **Symptom with multiple connections:**
>    ```
>    ERROR - Timeout while waiting for connection
>    ERROR - No response received after 3 retries
>    ```
>    → This is NOT the add-on's fault, but competition for the connection!
>
> **Rule:** ONLY ONE Modbus connection at a time = stable system ✅

## Configuration

Example configuration in Add-on UI:

```yaml
modbus_host: "192.168.1.100"
modbus_port: 502
slave_id: 1
mqtt_host: "core-mosquitto"
mqtt_port: 1883
mqtt_user: ""
mqtt_password: ""
mqtt_topic: "huawei-solar"
log_level: "INFO"
status_timeout: 180
poll_interval: 30
```

### Options

#### Modbus Settings

- **modbus_host** (required)  
  IP address of your Huawei inverter (e.g., `192.168.1.100`).

- **modbus_port** (default: `502`)  
  Modbus TCP port.

- **slave_id** (default: `1`, range: 0-247)  
  Modbus Slave ID of the inverter. In many installations this is `1`, sometimes `16` or `0`.  
  **Tip:** Try different values (`0`, `1`, `16`) if you experience connection timeouts.

#### MQTT Settings

- **mqtt_host** (default: `core-mosquitto`)  
  MQTT Broker hostname. Leave empty or use `core-mosquitto` for HA Mosquitto Add-on.

- **mqtt_port** (default: `1883`)  
  MQTT Broker port.

- **mqtt_user** (optional)  
  MQTT username. Leave empty to use credentials from Home Assistant MQTT Service.

- **mqtt_password** (optional)  
  MQTT password. Leave empty to use credentials from Home Assistant MQTT Service.

- **mqtt_topic** (default: `huawei-solar`)  
  Base topic under which data is published.

#### Advanced Settings

- **log_level** (default: `INFO`)  
  Logging detail level:
  - `DEBUG`: Very detailed - shows performance metrics, individual register reads, timing measurements, error details, **filter details at every event**
  - `INFO`: Normal - shows important events and current data points (Solar/Grid/Battery Power), error recovery, **filter summaries every 20 cycles**
  - `WARNING`: Only warnings and errors
  - `ERROR`: Only errors

- **status_timeout** (default: `180`, range: 30-600)  
  Time in seconds after which status is set to `offline` if no successful query occurred.

- **poll_interval** (default: `30`, range: 10-300)  
  Query interval in seconds between two Modbus reads.  
  **Recommendation:** 30-60 seconds for optimal balance between freshness and network load.

#### Filter Settings (ENV variables, optional)

- **HUAWEI_FILTER_TOLERANCE** (default: `0.05`)  
  Tolerance for total_increasing filter as percentage (0.05 = 5%).  
  Values dropping more than this percentage are filtered as read errors.  
  **Recommendation:** 5% (default) is optimal for most installations.  
  **Example:** At 0.10, only drops > 10% are filtered (less strict).

## MQTT Topics

- **Sensor Data (JSON):**  
  `huawei-solar` (or your configured topic)  
  Contains all sensor data as JSON object with `last_update` timestamp.

- **Status (online/offline):**  
  `huawei-solar/status`  
  Used for:
  - Binary Sensor "Huawei Solar Status"
  - `availability_topic` of all sensors
  - MQTT Last Will Testament (automatically `offline` on connection loss)

### Common Issues & Solutions

#### Connection Timeout Error

**Symptom:**

```
ERROR - Timeout while waiting for connection. Reconnecting
TimeoutError
```

**Solutions:**

1. **Change Slave ID** - Most common solution!
   - Try: `0`, `1`, `16`
   - Some dongles use different IDs

2. **Increase Poll Interval**
   - From `30` to `60` or higher
   - Gives more time for slow connections

3. **Check Network**
   - Ping inverter: `ping <IP>`
   - Check latency and packet loss

4. **Check FusionSolar Cloud**
   - Cloud connection can block Modbus
   - Temporarily disable for testing

5. **Enable DEBUG Log**
   - Shows exactly which register hangs on timeout

#### Modbus Connection Error

**Symptom:**

```
ERROR - Connection failed: [Errno 111] Connection refused
```

**Solutions:**

- Check IP address and port
- Enable Modbus TCP in inverter web interface
- Try different Slave IDs (0, 1, 16)
- Check firewall rules
- With `log_level: DEBUG`, details are shown

#### MQTT Connection Error

**Symptom:**

```
ERROR - MQTT publish failed: [Errno 111] Connection refused
```

**Solutions:**

- Check MQTT Broker in Home Assistant (Settings → Add-ons → Mosquitto)
- Verify credentials
- Set `mqtt_host` to `core-mosquitto`
- In DEBUG mode, connection details are logged

#### Performance Issues

**Symptom:**

```
WARNING - Cycle 52.1s > 80% poll_interval (30s)
```

**Solutions:**

- Increase `poll_interval` (e.g., from 30s to 60s or 120s)
- Check network connection to inverter
- Analyze timing measurements in DEBUG log
- For very slow networks, use `poll_interval: 120s`

#### Filter Activity (NEW in 1.6.0)

**Symptom:**

```
INFO - 📊 Published - PV: 788W | AC Out: 211W | Grid: 11W | Battery: 569W 🔍[3 filtered]
```

**Meaning:** The add-on detected and filtered invalid counter values (likely Modbus read errors)

**Normal behavior:** Occasional filtering (1-2 per hour) is expected and protects your energy statistics

**Investigate if:** Frequent filtering (every cycle) indicates connection issues

- Enable DEBUG mode to see which sensors are filtered
- Check Modbus connection stability
- Consider increasing poll_interval

**Understanding filter summaries:**

```
🔍 Filter summary (last 20 cycles): 0 values filtered - all data valid ✓
```

→ Perfect! No problems in the last 20 cycles

```
🔍 Filter summary (last 20 cycles): 3 values filtered | Details: {'energy_yield_accumulated': 2, 'battery_charge_total': 1}
```

→ 3 values filtered in 20 cycles - acceptable, shows occasional read errors

#### Critical Key Warnings

**Symptom:**

```
WARNING - Critical 'meter_power_active' missing, using 0
```

**Cause:** Your inverter has no Power Meter or different hardware configuration

**Solution:** Warning is normal, add-on automatically sets fallback values (0)

## Tips & Best Practices

### Initial Setup

1. Set `log_level: INFO` to see important events
2. Start the add-on and check logs
3. Wait for "Connected (Slave ID: X)" and "TotalIncreasingFilter initialized"
4. Check first data points in log
5. Observe filter summary after 20 cycles
6. Go to MQTT Integration and enable desired entities

### Connection Timeout Problems

1. **Vary Slave ID:**

   ```yaml
   slave_id: 0 # Try 0, 1, 16
   ```

2. **Increase Poll Interval:**

   ```yaml
   poll_interval: 60 # Instead of 30
   ```

3. **Enable DEBUG:**

   ```yaml
   log_level: DEBUG
   ```

4. **Test Network:**
   - SSH/Terminal: `ping <INVERTER_IP>`
   - Latency under 50ms = good

### Normal Operation

- Use `log_level: INFO` for clear logs
- `poll_interval: 30-60s` for optimal performance
- Occasionally monitor cycle times in log
- Observe filter summaries every 20 cycles
- Error tracker automatically shows recovery statistics

### Performance Optimization

- Watch for WARNING messages in log
- If cycle times > 80% poll_interval → increase `poll_interval`
- DEBUG level shows exact timing measurements for each step
- Error tracker provides insight into connection stability
- Filter activity shows data quality

### Troubleshooting

- DEBUG level shows exactly which registers are read
- Check `binary_sensor.huawei_solar_status` for connection status
- Regularly check logs for warnings/errors
- Filter summaries show data quality
- Watch Health Check in Home Assistant Add-on status
- Error recovery messages show downtime and error types

### Filter Monitoring (NEW in 1.6.0)

- **INFO level:** Filter summary every 20 cycles shows long-term trend
- **DEBUG level:** Detailed filter info at every event
- **Inline indicator:** `🔍[X filtered]` shows immediately when filtered
- **Occasional filtering:** 1-2 per hour is normal and acceptable
- **Frequent filtering:** Indicates Modbus connection problems
- **No filtering:** `0 values filtered - all data valid ✓` is optimal

### Multi-Inverter Setup

The add-on is currently designed for one inverter. For multiple inverters:

- Install the add-on multiple times (different names)
- Use different `mqtt_topic` values
- Configure different `modbus_host` addresses

## Health Check

The add-on has an integrated health check:

- Checks every 60 seconds if Python process is running
- Status visible at: **Settings → Add-ons → Huawei Solar → Status**
- If `unhealthy` → restart add-on
