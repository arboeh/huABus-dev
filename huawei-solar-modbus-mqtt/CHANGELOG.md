# Changelog

## [1.5.1] - 2026-01-18

### Fixed

- **Library Version Detection**: Startup logs now correctly display installed versions of `huawei-solar`, `pymodbus`, and `paho-mqtt`
  - Previously showed "unknown" due to hardcoded placeholder in `run.sh`
  - Now dynamically detects versions via Python's `__version__` attribute

### Changed

- **Startup Information**: Enhanced system info display with actual library versions

  [18:01:44] INFO: >> System Info:  
  [18:01:44] INFO: - Python: 3.12.12

- `main.py`: Enhanced `log_cycle_summary()` to include `battery_soc` in human-readable output
- No breaking changes - fully backwards compatible

## [1.5.0] - 2026-01-16

### Added

- **MQTT Connection Stability**: Wait loop and retry logic for reliable MQTT publishing
- **Connection State Tracking**: Global `_is_connected` flag prevents "not connected" errors
- **Development Environment**: PowerShell runner (`run_local.ps1`) and `.env` support for local testing
- **Exception Handling**: Improved Modbus exception handling with `is_modbus_exception()` helper

### Fixed

- **MQTT Publish Failures**: Added `wait_for_publish()` to all MQTT operations
- **Race Condition**: 1-second delay after MQTT connect ensures stable connection before publishing
- **paho-mqtt 2.x Support**: Version-compatible client creation with `CallbackAPIVersion.VERSION2`

### Changed

- **MQTT Client**: Callbacks now properly update connection state for reliable publish operations
- **Connection Timeout**: Increased from implicit to explicit 10-second wait with proper error handling

### Technical Details

- Connection wait loop polls `_is_connected` flag every 100ms up to 10 seconds
- All `publish()` calls now wait for confirmation with 1-2 second timeout
- Exception handling no longer uses `isinstance()` directly in except clauses to avoid BaseException errors

## [1.4.2] - 2026-01-09

### Added

- `.gitattributes` for enforced LF line endings across all text files (Linux/Docker compatibility)
- `.editorconfig` for standardized editor configuration (indent, charset, line endings)
- `.gitignore` with comprehensive Python/Docker/IDE exclusions
- GitHub Issue Templates for structured bug reports and feature requests
- GitHub Release Workflow for automated releases

### Changed

- Normalized all repository files to LF line endings (prevents `/bin/sh: bad interpreter` errors)
- Enhanced `.dockerignore` to properly include required Home Assistant files (CHANGELOG.md, DOCS.md)
- Improved `__init__.py` files with package docstrings for better code organization
- Updated `requirements.txt` with version constraints to prevent breaking changes

### Fixed

- Corrected `pymodbus` version requirement from non-existent `3.11.4` to `>=3.7.4,<4.0.0`
- Fixed potential line ending issues on Windows development environments
- Resolved `.dockerignore` accidentally excluding required add-on documentation

### Documentation

- Added troubleshooting guide for connection timeout issues (Slave ID configuration)
- Updated community support information with GitHub Issues link

## [1.4.1] - 2026-01-08

### Changed

- Enhanced startup logging with emoji icons (🚀🔌📡📍⏱️)
- Added visual separator lines in connection summary
- Set bashio log level dynamically based on HUAWEI_LOG_LEVEL
- Improved readability of startup configuration display

## [1.4.0] - 2026-01-08

**Features:**

- Error Tracker with intelligent error aggregation and downtime tracking
- Enhanced logging architecture with `log_cycle_summary()` function (supports JSON format for machine parsing)
- Bashio log level synchronization for consistent add-on logs across all components
- Performance optimization: `poll_interval` default lowered to 30s (previously 60s) for faster data updates

**Improvements:**

- ENV variables consistently named: `HUAWEI_SLAVE_ID` instead of `HUAWEI_MODBUS_DEVICE_ID` for better clarity
- Redundant logging removed: eliminated duplicate DEBUG statements in `main_once()` and `read_registers()`
- `publish_status()` optimized to DEBUG-level only (was INFO + DEBUG before)
- Dockerfile simplified: huawei_solar library patch removed (apply manually if needed for unknown enum values)
- run.sh refactored: removed legacy debug mode code, added case-based log level mapping
- DOCS.md fully synchronized with config.yaml defaults and updated examples

**Bugfixes:**

- Docstrings corrected: `publish_data()` now correctly documents exception behavior
- Connection recovery messages now include downtime duration in seconds
- Fixed inconsistent default values between config.yaml and main.py

**Technical Details:**

- Error recovery logging format: `Connection restored after {downtime}s ({attempts} failed attempts, {types} error types)`
- All configuration examples updated to reflect `poll_interval: 30` default
- Recommended settings table adjusted: Standard scenario now 30s instead of 60s

**Breaking Changes:** None - fully backwards-compatible with existing configurations

## [1.3.5] - 2026-01-03

**Bugfix:** Template variable warnings in Home Assistant eliminated

- All optional sensor definitions now include `default()` filters in `value_template` to prevent "dict object has no attribute" warnings
- Affected sensors: All battery values, PV strings 2-4, grid phases B/C, meter phases, efficiency, and status fields
- **Root cause:** `_cleanup_result()` removes `None` values from JSON payload → missing keys in MQTT message → Home Assistant template errors
- **Solution:** Custom `value_template` with `| default(0)` for numeric sensors and `| default('unknown')` for text sensors
- `_build_sensor_config()` now respects custom `value_template` from sensor definitions instead of always generating standard template

**Dependencies:** Cleaned up and corrected to installable versions

- **Removed:** `backoff` and `pytz` (not used in codebase)
- `paho-mqtt` 2.1.0 unchanged (current stable)
- Reduces installation footprint and eliminates dependency resolution conflicts

## [1.3.4] - 2025-12-16

**Bugfix:** Logging statement corrected - Solar power was displayed incorrectly

- Log line "Published - Solar: XW" incorrectly used `power_active` (AC output power of inverter) instead of `power_input` (DC input power from PV modules)
- **Register meanings:**
- `power_input` (Register 32064) = actual solar/PV power (DC)
- `power_active` (Register 32080) = inverter AC output (combined from PV + battery)
- **Symptom:** At night, e.g. 240W "solar" power was displayed, although this was actually battery discharge
- **Solution:** Logging now correctly uses `mqtt_data.get('power_input', 0)` for solar display
- Fixes confusing nighttime values in log; MQTT data and Home Assistant entities were already correct

## [1.3.3] - 2025-12-15

**Bugfix:** MQTT Discovery validation error fixed

- Unit for reactive power sensors corrected from `VAr` to `var` (Home Assistant requires lowercase for `device_class: reactive_power`)
- Fixes error: "The unit of measurement `VAr` is not valid together with device class `reactive_power`"
- Affects sensors: `power_reactive` and `meter_reactive_power`

## [1.3.2] - 2025-12-15

**Bugfixes:** Register names corrected for Battery Daily Charge/Discharge

- `storage_charge_capacity_today` → `storage_current_day_charge_capacity`
- `storage_discharge_capacity_today` → `storage_current_day_discharge_capacity`
- `alarm_1` register removed (not available on all inverter models, caused template errors)
- Fixes "Template variable warning: 'dict object' has no attribute" error in Home Assistant

**Dependencies:** All core dependencies updated to latest stable versions

- `huawei-solar`: 2.3.0 → **2.5.0**
- `paho-mqtt`: 1.6.1 → **2.1.0** (MQTT 5.0 support)
- `pymodbus`: 3.8.6 → **3.7.4**

## [1.3.1] - 2025-12-10

- Register set expanded to **58 Essential Registers**; all names strictly aligned with `huawei-solar-lib` (including grid/meter registers and capitalization)
- Full 3-phase smart meter support: phase power, current, line-to-line voltages, frequency and power factor are now published as individual MQTT values
- MQTT Discovery sensors synchronized with new keys and consistently using `unit_of_measurement`, compliant with Home Assistant MQTT specification
- PV power sensors removed; only PV voltage/current are transmitted, allowing power calculation in Home Assistant via template if needed
- Add-on option `modbus_device_id` renamed to `slave_id` to avoid conflicts with Home Assistant device IDs

## [1.3.0] - 2025-12-09

**Config:** Configuration moved to config/ (registers.py, mappings.py, sensors_mqtt.py) with 47 Essential Registers and 58 sensors  
**Registers:** Five new registers (including smart meter power, battery today, meter status, grid reactive power) and 13 additional entities for battery bus and grid details
