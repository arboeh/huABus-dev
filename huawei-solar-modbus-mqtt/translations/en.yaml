configuration:
  modbus_host:
    name: Inverter IP Address
    description: >
      IP address of your Huawei Solar Inverter in your local network.

      💡 Tip: Find the IP in your router's DHCP settings or active connections.

      📍 Example: 192.168.1.100

  modbus_port:
    name: Modbus TCP Port
    description: >
      Modbus TCP port of the inverter.

      🔧 Default: 502 (usually no change needed)

      ℹ️ Only change if you configured a custom port.

  slave_id:
    name: Modbus Slave ID
    description: >
      Slave ID of your inverter in the Modbus network.

      🎯 Usually: 1 (default for most Huawei inverters)
      🔀 Sometimes: 0 or 16 (depending on model)
      👥 Multiple inverters: Check manufacturer documentation

      📊 Valid range: 1-247

  mqtt_host:
    name: MQTT Broker Address
    description: >
      Hostname or IP address of the MQTT broker.

      🏠 For Mosquitto add-on: "core-mosquitto"
      🌐 For external broker: IP address or hostname

      📍 Examples:
      • core-mosquitto (recommended for HA-internal broker)
      • 192.168.1.50
      • mqtt.local

  mqtt_port:
    name: MQTT Broker Port
    description: >
      Port of the MQTT broker.

      🔧 Default: 1883 (unencrypted)
      🔒 With TLS: 8883 (encrypted)

      ℹ️ Usually no change needed.

  mqtt_user:
    name: MQTT Username
    description: >
      Username for MQTT authentication.

      🔓 Optional: Leave empty if no authentication is required
      🔐 Recommended: Set username for better security

      💡 For Mosquitto add-on: Create user under "Mosquitto Broker" → "Logins"

  mqtt_password:
    name: MQTT Password
    description: >
      Password for MQTT authentication.

      🔓 Optional: Leave empty if no authentication is required
      🔐 Recommended: Use a strong password

      💡 Must match the user created under "MQTT Username"

  mqtt_topic:
    name: MQTT Base Topic
    description: >
      Main topic under which all sensor data will be published.

      📡 Default: "huawei-solar"
      📊 All sensors will appear under this topic

      ℹ️ Multiple inverters: Use different topics
      📍 Examples: huawei-solar, inverter-1, solar-garage

  log_level:
    name: Log Level
    description: >
      Verbosity of log output in the add-on.

      🔍 TRACE: Maximum detail incl. Modbus bytes (deep debugging only)
      🐛 DEBUG: Detailed with cycle timings and filter decisions
      ℹ️ INFO: Normal (recommended) - shows only important events
      ⚠️ WARNING: Warnings and errors only
      ❌ ERROR: Errors only

      💡 For normal operation: INFO
      💡 When troubleshooting: Enable DEBUG

  status_timeout:
    name: Offline Timeout
    description: >
      Time in seconds after which the inverter is marked as offline
      when no successful connection is possible.

      ⏱️ Default: 180 seconds (3 minutes)
      📊 Range: 30-600 seconds

      💡 Lower value: Faster offline detection
      💡 Higher value: More tolerant to brief network issues

  poll_interval:
    name: Poll Interval
    description: >
      Time interval in seconds between data queries from the inverter.

      ⏱️ Default: 30 seconds (recommended for best balance)
      📊 Range: 10-300 seconds

      ⚡ Shorter intervals (10-20s): More current data, higher network load
      🐌 Longer intervals (60-300s): Less load, less current data

      💡 For solar monitoring: 30 seconds is optimal
